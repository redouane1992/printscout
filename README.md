# PrintScout – TeePublic Product Research & Trend Scoring Tool

## Overview
PrintScout is a Python project that helps research TeePublic by collecting product data and scoring listings to identify designs that may be selling well.

The goal is to reduce manual research by automating discovery, sorting, and ranking based on simple signals (e.g., engagement indicators, recency, category, keywords).

## What it does
- Collects TeePublic listing data (search results / product pages depending on the module)
- Extracts key fields (title, tags/keywords, category, price, etc.)
- Applies a basic trend scoring logic to rank products
- Outputs results in a structured format for review (e.g., CSV/JSON)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Data processing / scoring logic
- Automation scripting

## Status
Under active development. Scoring and extraction logic are being improved for reliability.

## Notes
This project is intended for research and analysis only.
